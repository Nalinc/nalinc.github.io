<p>Hi! I am a Research Engineer in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.autodeskresearch.com/groups/user-interface">User Interface Research Group</a> at <a target="_blank" href="https://autodeskresearch.com/">Autodesk Toronto</a>. 
I graduated from <!-- <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/" >David R. Cheriton School of Computing Science</a> at the -->
the <a target="_blank" href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a> under the supervision of <a target="_blank" href="http://edithlaw.ca/"> Dr Edith Law</a>.
My research interests lies on the intersection of Interactive Machine Learning and Intelligent User Interfaces. 
Specifically, I explore ways to support humans through Context-Aware Systems and Natual Lanugae Processing.
<!-- Specifically, I like exploring how to effectively combine Human and Artificial Intelligence to augment natural human abilities. -->
<!-- I am currently studying how to effectively combine Human and Artificial Intelligence to argument teachers in K-12 classrooms.  -->
I love working at <code>/src</code> and constantly try to bridge the gap between humans and technology by building great products.
When not coding, I enjoy swimming, cycling, running, and cooking.</p>

<p>I completed <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/5665683559940096/">Google Summer Of Code 2018 (GSoC)</a> with AIMACode under the supervison of <a href="http://norvig.com/">Peter Norvig</a> (<i>Director Of Research @ Google</i>). Since then, I have been an organization-admin for AIMACode and involved in mentoring new GSoC students. I have also interned at other awesome places like <a href="http://rsvp.ai/">RSVP.ai</a>, <a href="https://home.cern/">CERN</a> and <a href="http://www.csir4pi.in/">CSIR-4PI</a>. Before coming to Waterloo, I was a part of <a href="http://crowdresearch.stanford.edu">Stanford Crowd Research Collective</a> led by <a href="https://hci.stanford.edu/msb/">Michael Bernstein</a> and worked as a Fullstack Software Engineer in <a href="https://www.comprotechnologies.com/#home">Compro</a>: an ed-tech company based in New Delhi. I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="http://ipu.ac.in/">Indraprastha University</a>, New Delhi.</p>

<!-- Inspired and impassioned by experiencing new things, I adore programming, take it very seriously and constantly seek to improve upon myself. I have learned to appreciate the value of what I have in life and what I do with it. I am passionate about understanding and learning how users respond to situations, systems and applications in order to better develop new technology that will meet their needs. I have a strong inclination towards Computer Science and Human Computer Interaction, and its application across disciplines of Education.
