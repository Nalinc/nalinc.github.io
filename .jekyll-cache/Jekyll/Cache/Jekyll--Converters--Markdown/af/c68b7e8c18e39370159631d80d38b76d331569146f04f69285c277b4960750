<p>Hi!
I am a Masterâ€™s student in the <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/">David R. Cheriton School of Computing Science</a> at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>. I am supervised by <a href="http://edithlaw.ca/"> Dr Edith Law</a> in the Human-Computer Interaction Lab. My research interests lies on the intersection of Human-AI Interaction and Intelligent User Interfaces.
I am currently studying how to effectively combine Human and Artificial Intelligence to argument teachers in K-12 classrooms. I love working at /src and constantly try to bridge the gap between the technology, and humans by building great products. When not coding, I enjoy running, watching movies and playing chess.</p>

<p>I completed <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/5665683559940096/">Google Summer Of Code 2018 (GSoC)</a> with AIMACode under the supervison of <a href="http://norvig.com/">Peter Norvig</a> (<i>Director Of Research @ Google</i>). Since then, I have been an organization-admin for AIMACode and involved in mentoring new GSoC students. I have also interned at other awesome places like <a href="http://rsvp.ai/">RSVP.ai</a> (Canada), <a href="https://home.cern/">CERN</a> (Geneva) and <a href="http://www.csir4pi.in/">CSIR-4PI</a> (Bangalore). Before coming to Waterloo, I was a part of <a href="http://crowdresearch.stanford.edu">Stanford Crowd Research</a> Collective led by <a href="https://hci.stanford.edu/msb/">Michael Bernstein</a> and worked as a fullstack Software Engineer in <a href="https://www.comprotechnologies.com/#home">Compro</a>: an ed-tech company based in New Delhi. I completed my Bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="http://ipu.ac.in/">Indraprastha University</a>, New Delhi.</p>

<!-- Inspired and impassioned by experiencing new things, I adore programming, take it very seriously and constantly seek to improve upon myself. I have learned to appreciate the value of what I have in life and what I do with it. I am passionate about understanding and learning how users respond to situations, systems and applications in order to better develop new technology that will meet their needs. I have a strong inclination towards Computer Science and Human Computer Interaction, and its application across disciplines of Education. If you find something related interesting, please come and talk to me!
