I")<p>Google Summer of Code is finally over and I had an amazing 4 months. This blog is meant to document my work in short. Checkout <a href="http://aimacode.github.io/aima-exercises">aima-exercises</a> and <a href="https://aima-exercises.firebaseapp.com/">aima-exercises-api</a> to see what I made during the summer of 2018.</p>

<h1 id="project">Project</h1>
<p>I worked with the organization AIMACode as a part of Google Summer of Code 2018. I was directly supervised by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norvig">Peter Norvig</a> for the project named “AIMA Exercises”. The goal was to design and implement a new platform to host interactive exercises for the fourth edition of the book “Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach”. This platform is not only meant to host the questions,  but also serve as a community to engage students and instructors.</p>

<h1 id="work-done">Work done</h1>
<p>Most of the commits I made during GSoC were in the repository <a href="https://github.com/aimacode/aima-exercises">aimacode/aima-exercises</a>. I also made few commits in a helper repository <a href="https://github.com/nalinc/aima-exercises-api">nalinc/aima-exercises-api</a> which hosted the microservice for API endpoints. In total, I submitted around 80 commits and changed a over 4000 files in both aima-exercises and aima-exercises-api</p>

<p>Following are the most significant commits I made during this period.</p>
